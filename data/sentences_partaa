HanyaHolm 's approach to teaching was to liberate each individual to define a technical style of his or her own that should express their inner personality and give freedom to explore. she would tell her students, ``you have a perfect right to branch out, if you have the stuff in you, if you discover your own richness, if you have something to say.'' holm's philosophy of teaching was how to find the essence of dance and understand where the movement comes from in the body that way it is a natural response in the dancer's body. she brought weltanschauung to her dance teaching. holm was strict; she expected greatness from her students which would come from a willingness to work hard. it was her thought that if you worked hard and truly wanted it, you would achieve the desired outcome. holm had an extremely keen eye, she had the ability to look at something and verbalize what she wanted using elaborate imagery and analogies. she used her technique class as a preparation for her improvisation and composition classes. these classes were where the students could expand and experiment on the skills that were presented in class, making the movement innate in their bodies. a large amount of holm's choreography came from the improv and comp classes. hanya holm taught anatomy, dalcroze eurhythmics, improvisation, and labanotation at her school. she taught at  ColoradoCollege
