PatriciaPreece , where she met a talented artist, dorothy hepworth, who became her lifelong companion. with the help of hepworth's wealthy family, they set up a home and studio together. both studied drawing with henry tonks. preece's early work was praised by vanessa bell, duncan grant and roger fry. in the early 1920s, they lived mostly in paris to continue their art studies, preece studying principally with andré lhote. there, they were influenced by the lesbian art world of natalie barney's salon. upon their return to london in 1925, however, they tried to avoid the opprobrium suffered by open lesbians and often claimed to be sisters. they became more involved with the bloomsbury group, some of the members of which they had met earlier. they spent summer holidays in wales or cornwall where patricia was again rescued from drowning, this time by a local mineworker. preece had a reputation for happily accepting casual flirtations from admirers, only to reject them when they became more serious. in 1928, preece and hepworth moved to cookham, living in a cottage purchased by hepworth's parents. the gregarious preece signed many of the shy hepworth's paintings and negotiated with dealers to exhibit and sell the work as preece's, fooling many in the art world, including the artist augustus john, who declared preece one of the six greatest women artists in england. in 1929, preece met cookham artist stanley spencer and his artist wife, hilda carline, while she was substituting as a waitress in a teashop in cookham. preece and hepworth became friendly with spencer and his wife, sometimes minding their daughters and joining their art picnics. carline's brother richard was attracted and took preece dining and dancing, until he understood the nature of her relationship with hepworth. the hepworths lost their fortune in the great depression, and from 1930, preece and hepworth were struggling to make mortgage payments. spencer introduced preece to his extensive art-world contacts. in may 1933, spencer's cosmopolitan patron, edward beddington-behrens invited patricia to travel with stanley to switzerland for a commission (preece spoke fluent french, while stanley spoke none). in 1933, preece first modelled for spencer, sitting for portrait of  SladeSchoolofFineArt
