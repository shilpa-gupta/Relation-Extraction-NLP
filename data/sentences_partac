MercedesValdivieso  (march 1, 1924--august 3, 1993) was a chilean writer, known since her earliest writings for the subversive nature of her texts. she first wrote la brecha (``breakthrough'') in 1961, which is considered to be the first feminist latin-american novel. this novel caused dismay from the reactionary segment of society and loud applause from the critics and is considered a revolutionary departure from the traditional treatment of the feminine role in marriage. ``breakthrough'' is a novel that ends with the heroine awareness that she didn't really need to depend upon a man in order to lead a fulfilling life. the book enjoyed an unexpected publishing success and went through five consecutive editions. mercedes valdivieso had the extreme audacity to become an innovator; she bridged the gap between romantic and domestic fiction in a society where women have been viewed as a sexless gender, icons of virtue, and depending on men to meet the necessities of life. valdivieso also was founder and director of ``adan'' a men's magazine, she published articles in newspapers and magazines and she gave many lectures and speeches. she taught literature at the university of peking, at the university of houston, at  StephenF.AustinStateUniversity
