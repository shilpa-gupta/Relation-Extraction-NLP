although argentina is the most well known rugby playing nation in south america , founding the argentine rugby union in 1899 , several other countries on the continent also have a long history . rugby had been played in brazil from the end of the 19th century , but the game was played regularly only from 1926 , when são paulo beat santos in an inter-city match . it took uruguay several aborted attempts to adapt to rugby , led mainly by the efforts of the montevideo cricket club ; succeeding in 1951 with the formation of a national league and four clubs . other south american countries to have set up a rugby union include chile ( 1948 ) , and paraguay ( 1968 ) . many asian countries have a tradition of playing rugby going back to the time of the british empire . india began playing rugby in the early 1870s , the calcutta football club forming in 1872. after the withdrawal of the british military from the area at the end of the decade , rugby in india faltered . india 's lasting legacy to the sport was the presentation of the calcutta cup to the rugby football union ; the world 's oldest international rugby trophy which is played for annually between england and scotland . sri lanka claims to have founded their union in 1878 , and although little official information from the period is available , the team won the all-india cup in madras in 1920. malaysia also suffers from poor record keeping . historically the first recorded match in malaysia was in 1892 , but the first confirmation of rugby is the existence of the hms malaya cup which , named after the ship hms malaya , was first presented in 1922 and is still awarded to the winners of the malay sevens . rugby union was introduced to japan in 1899 by ginnosuke tanaka a student of trinity hall , cambridge and edward bramwell clarke , who studied at corpus christi college , cambridge . the japan rfu was founded in 1926 and its place in rugby history was cemented with the news that japan will host the 2019 world cup . it will be the first country outside the commonwealth , ireland and france to host the event , and is viewed by the irb as an opportunity for rugby union to extend its reach , particularly in asia . other asian playing countries of note include singapore , south korea and china , while the former british colony of hong kong is notable within rugby for its development of the rugby sevens game , especially the hong kong sevens tournament which was founded in 1976. rugby in the middle east and the gulf states has its history in the 1950s , with clubs formed by british and french services stationed in the region after the second world war . when these servicemen left , the clubs and teams were kept alive by young professionals , mostly europeans , working in these countries . the official union of oman was formed in 1971 , with his majesty qaboos bin said al said as patron . bahrain founded its union a year later , while in 1975 the dubai sevens , the gulf 's leading rugby tournament , was created by the dubai exiles rugby club . rugby remains a minority sport in the region with israel , as of 2011 , being the only member union from the middle east to be included in the irb world rankings .

buffy the vampire slayer had been very successful in its first three seasons on television , but some of the characters left the series and storylines ended , creating a need for an entire shift in location and mission . buffy and the core group of friends who fight with her graduate from high school , while the school itself was blown up in the third season finale . the fourth season , therefore , presents viewers with buffy , her best friends willow ( alyson hannigan ) , xander ( nicholas brendon ) , and mentor giles ( anthony head ) at a crossroads . series creator joss whedon called it a `` strange , sort of schizophrenic season '' with a `` weird incoherence '' , but also stated that the episodes in the fourth season were among the series ' best . the writers set out to explore the characters ' trials as they discover more about themselves following the defining years of high school . although they had been a cohesive group of friends in the first three seasons , situations arise in the fourth to separate them . the writers focused on each of the four core characters individually throughout the season to increase the impact of their finally coming back together in the penultimate episode , `` primeval '' , when they merge their essences to form a super-buffy in order to defeat adam . buffy studies scholar roz kaveney states that estrangement from the self and others is the primary theme of the fourth season . to illustrate the absolute search for identity , the series writers created adam , who is more truly alone than is anyone else . he is a creature assembled from a man , vampires , demons , and cutting edge cybernetic technology . adam was not the first re-animated corpse to be presented in the series . `` some assembly required '' in the second season also had a frankenstein monster-like creation and `` beauty and the beasts '' in the third includes references to strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde ; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science . whedon has long been interested in science fiction . he wrote the script for the film alien resurrection ( 1997 ) , where an extra-terrestrial creature is bred from a human and an alien in a laboratory , and was a series writer for the television series the x-files , about a government agency that tracks supernatural occurrences and aliens . buffy uses both science and magic as narrative devices . according to author andrew aberdein , the series employs science in three ways : to demonstrate what contemporary science explains , to posit what science may be able to accomplish , and the dominance of supernatural forces over science . according to aberdein , adam , a `` kinematically redundant , bio-mechanical demonoid '' , is the series ' deepest exploration of scientific potential . series writer doug petrie states that adam is the embodiment of the invasion of science in a world where magic is the most powerful force . the series relied on its own form of magic to explain buffy 's superpowers and other supernatural occurrences up to the fourth season . adam is `` what happens when people who believe in science use demons for military gain '' , according to petrie . the result is that science `` gets its ass kicked '' by magic . george hertzberg , a university of southern california graduate with experience in sitcoms and commercials , was chosen based on one of adam 's monologues he was given to read for the audition . hertzberg counted luck and being in the right place at the right time in helping him get the role . many recurring characters on buffy start with one or two episodes , and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors , they often make them a regular part of the cast . hertzberg , however , understood at his reading that adam was to be a major part of the fourth season . casting director amy britt needed someone physically imposing for the part , with the hertzberg fitting the bill . britt stated , `` this is a guy we 're going to want eventually to have some affinity for . we ca n't just see him as an evil being . he is evil to the core and should scare us with his actions ; but there 's also innocence . like the frankenstein monster , you realize the they 're only doing what they know . or what they 've been programmed to do . these are n't born creatures , these are creations .

'' he felt that he `` brought show back to a more story-oriented '' approach and increased the focus on characters and their emotions , while `` at the same time still keeping it surreal and weird '' . during his tenure , mirkin moved the show 's focus toward homer , and also developed some of the secondary characters , including apu . he also strongly opposed censorship and network interference , telling post-production supervisor colin a.b.v . lewis to ignore the list of changes sent by the fox censors . he aimed to put `` as much blood and guts '' as possible into the episode `` treehouse of horror v '' as an attack on the censors . mirkin 's era and style of humor are popular amongst the show 's fans .
